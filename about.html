  <h1>About Me</h1>
</section>

<section class="intro">
  <p>
    I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Applied Science in Mechatronics and
    Robotics Engineering at Queen’s University (Class of 2028). My interests lie
    in aerospace systems, avionics, and systems integration, with a strong focus
    on applying theory through hands-on design, testing, and iteration.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through my involvement with Queen’s Aerospace Design Team, I have developed
    experience working across electrical, software, mechanical, and systems
    teams to deliver reliable, flight-ready solutions. I am particularly drawn
    to roles that combine technical depth with team leadership and coordination.
