  <h2>PID Tuning of Drone</h2>
  <p><em>Spring 2025</em></p>
  <p>
    Tuned and calibrated PID parameters in QGroundControl to improve flight
    stability and control responsiveness. Conducted structured test flights,
    analyzed logs, and isolated issues including rate-gain imbalance,
    interference, and sensor noise.
  </p>
  <p>
    Refined rate and attitude control loops through controlled parameter sweeps,
    reducing oscillations and achieving smoother, more predictable flight
    behaviour. Designed and implemented a test rig to improve safety and reduce
    risk of airframe damage during testing.
  </p>

  <h2>Stewart (Hexapod) Platform</h2>
  <p><em>Summer 2025</em></p>
  <p>
    Designed, modelled, and fabricated a six-degree-of-freedom Stewart platform
    using FreeCAD. Iterated linkage geometry and structural components to improve
    motion range and rigidity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Developed Arduino-based control code and a laptop user interface to
    coordinate six servo actuators and enable precise platform motion.
